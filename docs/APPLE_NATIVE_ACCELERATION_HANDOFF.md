# Apple-Native Acceleration Handoff

## Purpose

This document is a fresh-context handoff for the current Apple Silicon native acceleration phase.

It is written for either:

- a new agent starting with no prior chat history
- a human who needs a concise technical state-of-play

The focus of this phase is narrow:

- use Apple-native frameworks and execution paths effectively on Apple Silicon
- validate whether MLX is a practical native training path for nanochat
- avoid drifting into broader architecture work unless it directly supports that goal

## Executive State

The Apple-native MLX track is already past feasibility.

That decision is no longer the question.

The current state is:

- MLX forward, backward, and optimizer-step execution are working
- the MLX reference prototype beats the frozen PyTorch + MPS baseline materially on the synthetic reference workload
- PyTorch-to-MLX weight translation is implemented and numerically validated
- a short-run MLX training sanity check is implemented and passing
- a longer reference-tier MLX training session has been executed successfully on the stable eager MLX path
- an experimental Muon-style matrix optimizer exists, but it is much slower than the current grouped-AdamW matrix path
- dataset-backed MLX input mode exists in code, but could not be exercised because local parquet shards are not available on this machine
- dataset-backed MLX input mode has now been exercised successfully on this machine
- real-checkpoint MLX validation has been partially exercised: a short local base checkpoint was translated into MLX, continued training cleanly, and exported as a `.safetensors` boundary artifact for native runtime work

The current best practical Apple-native training path is:

- MLX model
- MLX fused attention and RoPE
- MLX eager execution
- grouped AdamW-style optimizer path for stability and speed
- repeated synthetic batch input
- optional initialization from translated PyTorch reference weights

## What Has Been Implemented

### Core MLX Prototype

Implemented in [mlx_gpt_prototype.py](../dev/mlx_gpt_prototype.py):

- GPT-style token embedding and LM head
- transformer block stack
- fused causal attention using MLX scaled dot-product attention
- RoPE using MLX native implementation
- stateless RMSNorm helper
- ReLU squared MLP
- residual scalar controls via `resid_lambdas` and `x0_lambdas`
- alternating value embeddings with gating

### Optimizer Paths

Implemented optimizer paths:

- grouped AdamW-style optimizer path for the main MLX prototype
- experimental Muon-style matrix optimizer for closer algorithmic resemblance to nanochat

Important current judgment:

- grouped AdamW path is the practical path
- Muon-style path is exploratory only at this point

### Translation And Initialization

Implemented in [mlx_checkpoint_translation.py](../dev/mlx_checkpoint_translation.py):

- PyTorch config to MLX config mapping
- PyTorch `state_dict` to MLX parameter-tree translation
- initialization from a matching fresh PyTorch reference model
- optional initialization from checkpoint source when local checkpoints exist

Validation script:

- [compare_pytorch_mlx_translation.py](../dev/compare_pytorch_mlx_translation.py)

### Benchmarking And Checks

Implemented execution tooling:

- [benchmark_mlx_reference.py](../dev/benchmark_mlx_reference.py)
- [mlx_training_check.py](../dev/mlx_training_check.py)
- [mlx_training_session.py](../dev/mlx_training_session.py)

Coverage:

- short synthetic benchmark runs
- short-run training health checks with explicit pass/fail criteria
- longer training session execution with periodic progress output

### Input Modes

Implemented in [mlx_input_batches.py](../dev/mlx_input_batches.py):

- repeated synthetic reference batch mode
- dataset-backed batch mode using nanochat tokenizer and parquet text iteration

Status:

- repeated mode is exercised and working
- dataset-backed mode is implemented but not yet validated on this machine because local data shards are missing

## Verified Results

### Frozen Baseline Reference

Frozen PyTorch + MPS baseline from the project docs:

- throughput: about `161.9 tok/s`
- MPS driver memory: about `67.36 GB`

### MLX Reference Benchmark

Reference-tier MLX benchmark on the practical grouped-AdamW matrix path:

- configuration: `depth=32`, `batch=2`, `seq=1024`
- params: `2,818,575,424`
- throughput: about `897` to `905 tok/s`
- peak memory: about `49.0 GB`

Interpretation:

- MLX is about `5.5x` faster than the frozen PyTorch + MPS baseline on this synthetic reference benchmark
- MLX peak memory is lower than the baseline memory footprint

### PyTorch-To-MLX Translation Validation

Small-model translation check:

- max absolute logit diff: about `1.83e-7`
- mean absolute logit diff: about `3.08e-8`
- loss absolute diff: `0.0`

Interpretation:

- translation is numerically correct for the overlapping model surface already implemented

### Short-Run Training Check

Reference-tier short-run MLX training check on grouped-AdamW matrix path:

- status: `PASS`
- initial loss: about `9.349`
- final loss: about `2.092`
- mean throughput: about `803 tok/s`
- peak memory: about `59.5 GB`

Interpretation:

- the MLX path is not just runnable, it behaves like a healthy training loop under repeated steps

### Longer Training Session

Reference-tier longer MLX training session on grouped-AdamW matrix path:

- configuration: `depth=32`, `batch=2`, `seq=1024`, `steps=32`, `warmup=2`
- execution mode: eager MLX
- initialization: translated PyTorch reference weights
- initial measured loss: about `2.092`
- final loss: about `0.540`
- minimum loss: about `0.501`
- loss drop: about `74.2%`
- mean throughput: about `905 tok/s`
- peak memory: about `49.0 GB`
- wall time: about `72.4 s`

Interpretation:

- the current stable Apple-native MLX training path holds up over a materially longer session, not just a few steps

### Experimental Muon Path

Reference-tier Muon-style matrix optimizer runs:

- short-run health check: `PASS`
- mean throughput during health check: about `258 tok/s`
- raw benchmark throughput: about `269 tok/s`

Interpretation:

- numerically healthy
- not performance-competitive with the grouped-AdamW matrix path
- currently not the recommended path for this phase

## What Is Working Really Well

This section is intentionally human-readable rather than process-heavy.

### MLX Is a Real Win on This Machine

The core conclusion is strong and already supported by execution evidence.

MLX is not just theoretically attractive here. It is already materially better than the current PyTorch + MPS baseline for the specific reference workload this phase uses.

That matters because it means the Apple-native direction is justified by measurements, not preference.

### The Stable Path Is Actually Stable

The grouped-AdamW MLX path is doing the important things correctly:

- it runs reliably
- it trains without non-finite values
- it reduces loss meaningfully over both short and longer runs
- it keeps memory under control
- it sustains strong throughput over the reference session

That is enough to treat it as a legitimate prototype training path, not a toy demo.

### Translation Is Better Than Expected

The PyTorch-to-MLX translation layer is in very good shape.

The numerical agreement on the validation run is extremely tight, which removes a major source of ambiguity. That means future comparisons can start from comparable initialized weights rather than from unrelated random seeds.

### Apple-Native Primitives Are Already Paying Off

The parts that should matter most for an Apple-native path are already contributing:

- MLX fused attention
- MLX RoPE
- MLX tensor execution on Apple Silicon
- MLX memory behavior

There is no sign that the project is blocked on some missing Apple-native primitive for the current prototype scope.

## What Needs Improvement

### Optimizer Parity Is Still the Main Technical Gap

The fastest stable MLX path is not yet the closest path to nanochat’s current optimizer design.

Right now the practical winner is grouped AdamW, while the more Muon-like path is much slower. So the open problem is not “can we make Muon-like math run,” but rather “can we make a closer optimizer path run without giving away the Apple-native performance advantage.”

That is the single biggest technical gap still open in this phase.

### Dataset Parity Is Still Incomplete

The strongest benchmark story is still driven by the reference repeated-batch path.

That said, dataset-backed mode is no longer just a code path. It has now been exercised successfully on this machine and holds roughly the same throughput as the repeated AdamW path at the reference configuration.

What is still incomplete is full trainer parity with the production loader, not basic real-data viability.

### Real Checkpoint Validation Is Still Missing

The translation path can now initialize from a real local checkpoint, and that path has been exercised with a short MPS-produced base checkpoint.

What remains open is strict numerical parity on trained checkpoints. The continuation path is healthy, but checkpoint logit agreement is not yet at the small-model `~1e-7` level.

Separately, the Apple-native runtime seam now exists on the Python side: translated MLX weights can be exported as `.safetensors` plus sidecar metadata for a future `mlx-swift` inference binary.

### Compiled MLX Training-Step Reuse Works With Explicit State Capture

An important attempted improvement was to push the longer training loop through `mx.compile` for a more purely Apple-native compiled execution path.

Current conclusion:

- the unsafe implicit stateful-closure form still crashes
- repeated stateful optimizer updates work when `mx.compile` captures model and optimizer state explicitly via `inputs=` and `outputs=`
- the MLX harnesses now expose this as `--execution-mode compiled`, and compiled mode is now the default after holding up on the full d32 reference workload
- a Phase 5 extended inference sweep (2026-03-19) ran one-shot and persistent worker benchmarks at 32, 64, and 128 output tokens: the crossover is confirmed at ~50 tokens for both paths; Swift persistent decode stays flat at ~32ms while Python full-recompute grows from 29ms (32 tok) to 42ms (128 tok); at 128 tokens persistent is 1.31x faster; see `runs/mlx_logs/phase5_inference_oneshot_sweep_20260319-042411.log` and `runs/mlx_logs/phase5_inference_persistent_sweep_20260319-042831.log`

Latest confirmation on this machine (2026-03-18): the probe at [dev/mlx_compiled_training_probe.py](../dev/mlx_compiled_training_probe.py) now tests both the crashing implicit form and the explicit-state form. In the current local MLX environment, pure `mx.compile` succeeds, the implicit stateful optimizer-update probe still exits with `SIGSEGV` (`returncode=-11`), and the explicit-stateful compile path succeeds. See [runs/mlx_logs/phase4c_compiled_probe_d0_probe_20260318-002634.json](../runs/mlx_logs/phase4c_compiled_probe_d0_probe_20260318-002634.json).

This is important because it means "Apple-native" is already true, and a compiled stateful training loop is now available in Python MLX without needing a Swift rewrite. That question is now answered on the real reference workload: on the d32 repeated benchmark, eager measured about `904.55 tok/s` while compiled reached about `1121.64 tok/s` with the same 2-step harness, a roughly `1.24x` speedup. See [runs/mlx_logs/phase5_reference_eager_d32_repeated_20260318-003227.json](../runs/mlx_logs/phase5_reference_eager_d32_repeated_20260318-003227.json) and [runs/mlx_logs/phase5_reference_compiled_d32_repeated_20260318-003243.json](../runs/mlx_logs/phase5_reference_compiled_d32_repeated_20260318-003243.json).
Extended validation confirms the compiled advantage is not an artifact of repeated-batch input: dataset-backed compiled measured about `1106.66 tok/s` vs eager at about `921.03 tok/s` (~20% gain). The Muon candidate (attn_only, ns=2, float16) passed all 7 success criteria under compiled mode with 75.6% loss reduction at `688 tok/s`. A sustained 32-step compiled AdamW session maintained `1121.6 tok/s` mean throughput with loss dropping 82.1% (2.30 → 0.41) and stable memory. See logs: `phase5_dataset_compiled_d32_dataset_20260318-010305.json`, `phase5_dataset_eager_d32_dataset_20260318-010324.json`, `phase5_muon_check_compiled_d32_repeated_20260318-010405.json`, `phase5_session_compiled_adamw_d32_repeated_20260318-010525.json`.
## Recommended Default Path Right Now

If a fresh agent needs to continue this phase without overthinking it, default to this:

- use MLX, not PyTorch + MPS, for native prototype work
- use [mlx_gpt_prototype.py](../dev/mlx_gpt_prototype.py) as the core model surface
- use grouped-AdamW matrix path, not the Muon-style experimental path, unless the task is explicitly optimizer-parity research
- use translated PyTorch reference initialization when comparing runs
- use [mlx_training_check.py](../dev/mlx_training_check.py) for health checks
- use [mlx_training_session.py](../dev/mlx_training_session.py) for longer runs
- compiled mode is the preferred default for the MLX benchmark, check, and session harnesses; keep `--execution-mode eager` available only as an explicit fallback or comparison mode
- use compiled mode only through the explicit-state path already wired into those scripts; do not reintroduce an implicit mutating closure around model and optimizer state
- use [export_mlx_safetensors.py](../dev/export_mlx_safetensors.py) when preparing a translated MLX checkpoint for an Apple-native runtime boundary
- treat optimizer-path investigation as separate from the Apple-native runtime track

## Recommended Next Actions

If continuing this phase, do these in order:

1. test the Swift MLX inference path at full reference scale (d32, ~2.8B params) to determine whether the KV-cache + Swift path produces a per-token latency win over Python MLX — at d4 scale Swift was 2x slower due to overhead dominating the tiny model (see `dev/benchmark_swift_vs_python.py`)
2. if the larger model shows a meaningful win, design the `engine.py` integration seam: Python keeps the state machine (`RowState`, `forced_tokens`, calculator parsing) and delegates the forward-pass + greedy loop to the Swift binary
3. keep Muon profiling as a deferred optimizer-specific investigation, not a blocker for the runtime track
4. treat compiled Python MLX as the default training-harness path, and re-evaluate Swift training-session work only if a later workload exposes a gap that compiled Python does not close

## Explicit Non-Goals For The Next Agent

Do not drift into these unless the task explicitly changes:

- general cross-platform abstraction work
- hybrid Python plus native hotspot replacement work
- inference-only packaging work
- Azure, deployment, UI, or unrelated repo cleanup
- speculative large refactors before dataset-backed and checkpoint-backed validation are attempted

```

## Final Takeaway

The Apple Silicon native phase is already successful enough to justify itself.

The practical Apple-native MLX training path is real, measurably better than the frozen PyTorch + MPS baseline on this machine, and stable enough to run longer sessions.

The remaining work is no longer basic feasibility.

The remaining work is evidence and refinement:

- dataset-backed validation
- real-checkpoint validation
- deciding how much optimizer parity is worth if it costs too much performance

## 2026-03-19 Continuation Instruction

Use this as the starting brief for the next agent working on Apple-native acceleration.

### Current validated state

- Priority 1 compiled-state hardening is done.
- The Swift inference seam has been re-validated against the real built worker, not just mocks.
- The live Swift worker rebuild issue is fixed: [main.swift](../swift/NanochatMLXStub/Sources/NanochatMLXStub/main.swift) now resets peak memory with `Memory.peakMemory = 0`, which is compatible with the pinned `mlx-swift` version.
- End-to-end `chat_cli` validation confirmed runtime-visible backend reason codes and the live telemetry contract for the Swift path:
	- `ttft_ms`
	- `decode_ms_per_token`
	- `active_memory_gb`
	- `peak_memory_gb`
	- `cache_memory_gb`
	- `persistent_worker_reuse_count`
- The default automatic Swift-routing threshold has been lowered from `64` to `48` output tokens in [swift_stub_engine.py](../nanochat/swift_stub_engine.py), based on fresh M2 Ultra measurements.
- Focused regression coverage still passes:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_swift_stub_engine.py -q
```

### Fresh evidence to trust

On `runs/mlx_exports/mlx_reference_d32.json` with the real rebuilt worker:

- One-shot crossover sweep:
	- 32 tokens: Python `28.53 ms/token`, Swift `30.28 ms/token`
	- 48 tokens: Python `30.73 ms/token`, Swift `30.15 ms/token`
	- 64 tokens: Python `32.60 ms/token`, Swift `30.81 ms/token`
	- 96 tokens: Python `36.97 ms/token`, Swift `30.38 ms/token`
	- 128 tokens: Python `42.44 ms/token`, Swift `30.49 ms/token`
- Persistent-worker sweep:
	- 32 tokens: Swift `29.55 ms/token`
	- 48 tokens: Swift `29.11 ms/token`
	- 64 tokens: Swift `29.44 ms/token`
	- 96 tokens: Swift `27.92 ms/token`
	- 128 tokens: Swift `29.09 ms/token`

Interpretation: the shipped persistent worker is still slower than Python at 32 tokens, but it is already ahead by 48 tokens and widens from there. Keep the default at `48` unless new measurements on a real checkpoint overturn that.

### What remains to do next

1. Re-run the same `chat_cli` routing checks against a real cached base or SFT checkpoint if one becomes available under `~/.cache/nanochat`.
2. Add one smoke test or validation script for the Swift clean rebuild path so a stale binary cannot mask a broken source build again.
3. Keep PyTorch fallback behavior unchanged unless fixing correctness or safety.
4. Do not expand Swift deeper into training orchestration. The remaining work is runtime hardening, evidence, and guardrails.

### Exact instruction for the next agent

Continue from the March 19 validated Swift runtime state. Do not revisit training-side architecture. Treat Python MLX as the Apple-native training path and Swift MLX as an inference seam only. First check whether a real checkpoint now exists under `~/.cache/nanochat/{base_checkpoints,chatsft_checkpoints}`. If one exists, rerun end-to-end `scripts/chat_cli.py` checks for long greedy, short greedy, and incompatible sampling requests using the real checkpoint-backed PyTorch fallback and a matching MLX export if available. Confirm the backend reason codes and telemetry contract still match the current implementation. Then add the smallest practical clean-build smoke check for the Swift worker so the rebuild path is continuously trustworthy. Only change code if you find a real correctness or telemetry regression. If measurements still support it, keep the `48`-token default threshold.
